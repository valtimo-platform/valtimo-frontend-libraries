# Welcome at Valtimo

### What is Valtimo?
Valtimo is the low-code platform for Business Process Automation. Our goal is to make implementing business process automation and case management easy.

### What does the Valtimo platform contain?
- Valtimo consists of two services:
  - A Spring Boot Java/Kotlin backend
  - An Angular frontend
- Valtimo depends on two services:
  - Keycloak as an identity and access provider
  - A database (default is PostgreSQL)

### What are the 'Valtimo frontend libraries'?
This repository contains:
- A collection of Angular libraries that together form the Valtimo frontend
- The `app` module, containing an Angular application, used for library development

### Starting the Valtimo platform
Starting up the Valtimo platform requires three steps:
1. Starting the supporting Docker containers: Keycloak and PostgreSQL. Instructions for starting the supporting services can be found [here](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/blob/next-minor/README.md#start-docker-containers-for-supporting-services).
2. Starting the Valtimo backend. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/blob/next-minor/README.md#starting-the-valtimo-backend-libraries-from-source)
3. Starting the Valtimo frontend. Instructions can be found [here](#starting-the-valtimo-frontend-libraries-from-source)

### Starting the Valtimo frontend libraries from source
#### Prerequisites: node
1. Install `nvm`. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. Install Node v20: `nvm install 20 && nvm use 20`

#### Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the dependencies: `npm install`

#### Build libraries
Run the following command to build all the Valtimo libraries: `npm run libs-build-all`

#### Start application
- Run the following command to start the Angular application: `npm start`.
- When this command has been completed, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

### Making changes to the Valtimo frontend libraries
When making changes to the libraries, the modified libraries have to be rebuilt. The following command can be used to build one specific library: `npm run libs:build:libraryName`.
Note: it is possible to `watch` for changes in a specific library, building it automatically after a change has been saved. For rebuilding automatically use the following command: `npm run libs:watch:libraryName`.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code quality
#### Running the linter
To run TSLint on a specific library, run `npm run libs:lint:libraryName`.

#### Code formatting
Valtimo uses Prettier to format its code. Run the `prettier:check` command to check for formatting errors,
and `prettier:write` to automatically fix any errors.

We advise to configure your IDE to automatically format files on save.
- For IntelliJ IDEA please refer to [this page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/prettier.html#ws_prettier_install).
- For VS Code you can refer to [this guide](https://scottsauber.com/2017/06/10/prettier-format-on-save-never-worry-about-formatting-javascript-again/).

Please make sure your code conforms to the project's Prettier code formatting rules before
raising a Pull Request.

#### Running unit tests
Run the following command to run the unit tests: `npm run libs:test:libraryName`.
